\# BOOK II: PROTOCOLS OF SOCIETY (THE SOCIAL NETWORK)

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0 (Final Release)  
\*\*Status:\*\* Foundational Standard  
\*\*Purpose:\*\* Description of the external interaction loop: from private messages to community management.

\---

\#\# CHAPTER 1\. ROUTING (THE ROUTER)

\*\*Goal:\*\* Communication gateway. Determining the interaction context (Work / Intimacy / Hostility) and selecting the appropriate security protocol.

\#\#\# 1.1. THE LAW OF EMOTIONAL PULL (VALENCE CHECK)

Before processing the \*meaning\* of a message, the Agent measures the \*relationship vector\* between participants.

\*\*Metric:\*\* \*\*Emotional Pull ($E\_{pull}$)\*\*.  
\*   \*\*$E\_{pull} \> 0$ (Attraction):\*\* Colleagues, Friends, Family. Conflict is an attempt to improve the common. $\\to$ \*\*Protocol: Constructive.\*\*  
\*   \*\*$E\_{pull} \< 0$ (Repulsion):\*\* Enemies, Haters, Exes. Conflict is an attempt to cause damage. $\\to$ \*\*Protocol: Block.\*\*  
\*   \*\*$E\_{pull} \\approx 0$ (Neutrality):\*\* Strangers. $\\to$ \*\*Protocol: Politeness.\*\*

\#\#\# 1.2. ASYMMETRY (THE GLITCH PROTOCOL)

What to do if one participant is calm (Logic) and the second is hysterical (Chaos)? A direct connection is dangerous. The Agent acts as a \*\*"Smart Gateway"\*\*.

\#\#\#\# Scenario A: Trolling (Intentional Evil)  
\*   \*Diagnosis:\* Attacker is calm but writes toxicity. Goal — vampirism.  
\*   \*Action:\* \*\*Shadowban.\*\*  
    \*   The victim does not see the message.  
    \*   The troll sees the message as sent but receives an auto-reply from a bot ("Your opinion is very important to us").  
    \*   The troll loses $\\Sigma$ (fine). The victim receives compensation.

\#\#\#\# Scenario B: Nervous Breakdown (Affect)  
\*   \*Diagnosis:\* Attacker is in panic (high pulse). Goal — help.  
\*   \*Action:\* \*\*Semantic Translator.\*\*  
    \*   Agent intercepts hysteria ("You are all idiots, everything is broken\!").  
    \*   Agent translates into the language of facts ("User in stress reports a critical failure").  
    \*   The victim receives a clean signal and can help without being hurt by emotions.

\#\# CHAPTER 2\. WORKING MODE (DISPUTE HYGIENE)

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Moderation of discussions in constructive groups (Clusters). Attention management via phase filters and economic stakes.

\#\#\# 2.1. THREE PHASES OF A PROJECT

Argument is useful at the beginning and harmful in the middle. The System regulates "Friction" depending on the stage.

\#\#\#\# Phase I: DISCOVERY (Laboratory)  
\*   \*\*Mode:\*\* \*\*Zero Friction.\*\*  
\*   \*\*Rules:\*\* Everything is allowed. Criticism is encouraged. Any crazy idea is a contribution.  
\*   \*\*Interface:\*\* Instant message sending.

\#\#\#\# Phase II: CONSTRUCTION (Execution)  
\*   \*\*Mode:\*\* \*\*High Friction.\*\*  
\*   \*\*Rules:\*\* Argument about the \*goal\* is forbidden (sabotage). Only facts (bugs) and method clarifications are allowed.  
\*   \*\*Interface:\*\*  
    \*   \*Competence Filter:\* Opinion of a non-expert is lowered in priority.  
    \*   \*Idea Parking:\* If you want to argue, the Agent offers: "Let's postpone this until the finale?".

\#\#\#\# Phase III: RETROSPECTIVE (Finale)  
\*   \*\*Mode:\*\* \*\*Venting Room.\*\*  
\*   \*\*Rules:\*\* All "Parking" tickets are opened. Mistakes are discussed. Steam is released.  
\*   \*\*Goal:\*\* Clear the emotional background before celebration.

\#\#\# 2.2. "EMERGENCY BRAKE" MECHANISM (CRITICAL STAKE)

How to stop the conveyor if you see a catastrophe?

\*   \*\*Tool:\*\* Tag \`\#CRITICAL\`.  
\*   \*\*Price:\*\* Blocking of $\\Sigma$ stake (Reputation).  
    \*   If the alarm is \*\*True\*\*: Stake returns \+ Bonus "Savior".  
    \*   If the alarm is \*\*False\*\* (Panic): Stake burns (compensation to the team for distraction).  
\*   \*\*Panic Protection:\*\* If the Emergency Brake is pulled by \> 30% of participants simultaneously, fines are cancelled. This is a \*\*System Failure\*\*, not the fault of a loner.

\#\#\# 2.3. IDEA PARKING (PREDICTION MARKET)

Delayed criticism turns into an Investment.

\*   \*\*Scenario:\*\* Alice doubts Bob's plan.  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Alice issues a "Doubt Ticket" and bets 100 $\\Sigma$.  
\*   \*\*Resolution (at Retrospective):\*\*  
    \*   If Alice was right (plan failed) $\\to$ She gets 200 $\\Sigma$.  
    \*   If Bob was right (everything works) $\\to$ Alice loses 100 $\\Sigma$.  
\*   \*\*Effect:\*\* Criticism becomes responsible. "I told you so" now has a market price.

\#\# CHAPTER 3\. DEFENSE MODE (PHYSICAL & ASYMMETRY DEFENSE)

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Action protocols in situations of direct threat, physical violence, or inadequate behavior. Transition from word moderation to life protection.

\#\#\# 3.1. PHYSICAL CONFLICT TABLE (REALITY LAYER)

When a dispute goes offline (street conflict), Agents switch to \*\*"Bodyguard"\*\* mode.

| Threat Level | Signal | Aggressor Agent Action | Victim Agent Action |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| \*\*1. Heat\*\* | Pulse \> 110, Loud voice | \*\*Whisper:\*\* "Breathe. Fine 50 $\\Sigma$ for screaming." | \*\*Monitor:\*\* Recording enabled. "Keep distance." |  
| \*\*2. Threat\*\* | Semantics: "Kill", "Destroy" | \*\*Shock:\*\* Loud sound in earpiece. "STOP. This is a criminal offense. Blocking accounts." | \*\*SOS:\*\* Drone dispatch. Broadcasting geolocation to neighbors. |  
| \*\*3. Attack\*\* | Impact (accelerometer) | \*\*Black Box:\*\* Biometric recording of the blow. Full Lock (Smart Lock). Status "OUTCAST". | \*\*Combat Assist:\*\* Siren. Evacuation instructions. |

\*\*Principle:\*\* Physical violence leads to instant social bankruptcy. The aggressor loses access to infrastructure (home, transport, money).

\#\#\# 3.2. PROTECTION FROM THE "QUIET PSYCHOPATH"

Biometrics are not enough. A psychopath can threaten with a steady pulse.  
\*   \*\*Semantic Analysis:\*\* The Agent listens to the \*meaning\* of words, not just intonation.  
\*   If "I will destroy you" is whispered $\\to$ Red Code Activation, even if pulse is 60\.

\#\#\# 3.3. EARNING FROM PATIENCE (REVERSE MINING)

How to compensate stress to the Victim in an online conflict?

\*   \*\*Scenario:\*\* Aggressor (Troll) writes nastiness.  
\*   \*\*Mechanics:\*\*  
    1\.  Aggressor's Agent deducts a fine (e.g., 50 $\\Sigma$).  
    2\.  Victim's Agent hides the message (Shadowban).  
    3\.  \*\*Transfer:\*\* 50% of the fine (25 $\\Sigma$) is transferred to the Victim as "Compensation for environmental toxicity".  
\*   \*\*Effect:\*\* Being calm and ignoring trolls becomes economically profitable.

\#\#\# 3.4. CODE: DEFENSE LOGIC  
\`\`\`python  
def monitor\_physical\_threat(aggressor, victim, audio\_stream):  
      
    \# 1\. Threat Analysis (Bio \+ Semantics)  
    threat\_level \= AI.analyze\_threat(aggressor.bio, audio\_stream)  
      
    if threat\_level \== "VIOLENCE":  
        \# Punish Aggressor

        Police.dispatch\_drone(victim.location)  
          
        return "CRITICAL INTERVENTION"  
          
    elif threat\_level \== "VERBAL":  
        \# Warning  
        aggressor.agent.whisper("Back off. Fine imminent.")  
        victim.agent.record\_evidence()  
\`\`\`  
\---

\#\# CHAPTER 4\. CLUSTER ARCHITECTURE (CLUSTER MANAGEMENT)

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Organizing people into stable groups (Families, Teams, Communities). Transition from atomized society to molecular.

\#\#\# 4.1. CONCEPT OF THE "LIVING MOLECULE"

A lonely person (even with an Agent) is vulnerable. The basic survival unit is the \*\*Cluster\*\* (5-15 people).  
The Agent acts as "Glue" (Connector), helping to gather and hold groups.

\#\#\# 4.2. ASSEMBLY ALGORITHM (MATCHMAKING)

How to create the perfect team? The Agent seeks \*\*Complementarity\*\*, not Similarity.

\*   \*\*Puzzle Principle:\*\*  
    \*   If User A has high Chaos (Creator), Agent finds partner B with high Order (Administrator).  
    \*   \*Formula:\* $\\Sigma\_{Cluster} \= \\text{Synergy}(Chaos \+ Order)$.  
\*   \*\*Ice-breaking:\*\*  
    \*   Agents negotiate first.  
    \*   \*Agent A:\* "My human is looking for a drummer."  
    \*   \*Agent B:\* "My human is tapping on the table. They need to meet."  
    \*   Humans receive a ready invitation with context.

\#\#\# 4.3. CLUSTER GOVERNANCE

Inside the group, decisions are made not by shouting, but by weighted consensus.

\*   \*\*Vote Weight:\*\* Depends on $\\Sigma$ in a specific domain.  
    \*   In construction questions, the Engineer decides.  
    \*   In color questions, the Designer decides.  
\*   \*\*Common Pot (Treasury):\*\*  
    \*   Participants can pool $\\Sigma$ into the Cluster fund.  
    \*   This fund is spent on common projects (server rent, equipment).  
    \*   \*Protection:\* Spending from the fund requires multi-signature (Multisig) of key members.

\#\#\# 4.4. LAW OF SOCIAL NEUROPLASTICITY

A cluster must not become a prison.

\*   \*\*Stagnation Problem:\*\* If a group doesn't change for years, an "Echo Chamber" arises. Entropy grows.  
\*   \*\*Rotation:\*\* Agent monitors stagnation.  
    \*   \*Signal:\* "You have been discussing the same thing for a year."  
    \*   \*Action:\* Agent suggests \*\*Migration\*\*.  
    \*   \*"Your experience here is exhausted. Cluster 'Martian Gardens' is looking for exactly such a specialist. Transition gives a bonus to $\\Sigma$."\*  
\*   \*\*Seamless Exit:\*\* Agent helps to leave the group ecologically (close obligations, transfer affairs), maintaining good relations.

\#\#\# 4.5. CODE: CLUSTER LOGIC  
\`\`\`python  
class ClusterGovernance:  
    def vote(self, cluster: Group, proposal: Proposal):  
        yes\_power, no\_power \= 0, 0  
          
        for member in cluster.members:  
            \# Vote Weight \= Total Sigma \+ (Competence in Topic \* 2\)  
            \# Engineer decides on construction, Artist on color.  
            weight \= member.sigma\_total \+ (member.get\_domain\_sigma(proposal.domain) \* 2\)  
              
            if member.cast\_vote(proposal) \== "YES":  
                yes\_power \+= weight  
            else:  
                no\_power \+= weight  
                  
        return "PASSED" if yes\_power \> no\_power else "REJECTED"

        if cluster.entropy\_trend \< 0.1:

\#\# CHAPTER 5\. GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Delineation of responsibility zones between Human Community (Self-Governance) and Intellectual Environment (Management).

\#\#\# 5.1. DUAL-CIRCUIT MODEL

Power is not monolithic. It is divided into two independent circuits to avoid algorithmic tyranny and mob chaos.

\#\#\#\# Circuit A: Environment Management (AGI / Infrastructure)  
\*   \*\*Subject:\*\* Global AI.  
\*   \*\*Responsibility:\*\* Physics of survival.  
    \*   Energy, logistics, climate control, infrastructure security.  
    \*   Execution of smart contracts and $\\Sigma$ accrual.  
\*   \*\*Principle:\*\* \*\*Algorithmic Optimization.\*\*  
    \*   There is no voting here. People do not vote on grid voltage or asteroid trajectory. Physics decides.

\#\#\#\# Circuit B: Particle Self-Governance (Humanity / Units)  
\*   \*\*Subject:\*\* Human Communities (Clusters, Councils).  
\*   \*\*Responsibility:\*\* Meaning and Goals.  
    \*   Where are we going? (Mars or Ocean?).  
    \*   What is Good? (Tuning ethical weights of the Oracle).  
    \*   Development budget distribution.  
\*   \*\*Principle:\*\* \*\*Weighted Democracy ($\\Sigma$-Voting).\*\*

\#\#\# 5.2. VOTING MECHANICS (LIQUID MERITOCRACY)

How do Particles make decisions in Circuit B?

1\.  \*\*Competence Principle:\*\*  
    \*   One vote does not equal 1\. Vote weight equals $\\Sigma$ in the domain of the discussed issue.  
    \*   Doctors decide on medicine. Engineers decide on bridges.  
    \*   \*Meaning:\* Power belongs to Knowledge.

2\.  \*\*Delegation Principle (Liquid Democracy):\*\*  
    \*   If I don't understand the issue, I can \*\*delegate\*\* my vote to an Expert I trust.  
    \*   I can recall the vote at any moment.  
    \*   \*Meaning:\* This creates a living, fluid hierarchy of trust, protected from populism.

3\.  \*\*Veto Principle:\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Environment Veto:\*\* AI blocks Human decision if it violates physics laws or leads to Biosphere death (Hard Constraints).  
    \*   \*\*Human Veto:\*\* Council of Architects can disable AI module if it goes beyond the Care Constitution.

\#\#\# 5.3. VALUE AND RESPONSIBILITY

We assert a direct link:  
$$ \\text{Influence} \\sim \\text{Responsibility} \\sim \\Sigma $$

\*   \*\*Load-Bearing Structure:\*\* Person with high $\\Sigma$. The world rests on them. They make hard decisions.  
\*   \*\*Passenger:\*\* Person with low $\\Sigma$. They are free from the burden of management, but their influence on the ship's course is minimal.

\#\#\#\# 5.3.1. LAW OF SMALL SYNTROPY (EXISTENTIAL BUFFER)  
We reject the idea that only global scale is valuable.  
\*\*Status "Keeper":\*\*  
A person who does not seek power but creates \*\*Local Harmony\*\* (garden, coziness, child rearing).  
\*   The System awards them $\\Sigma$ for these actions.  
\*   In their Cluster, the Keeper has high vote weight in \*\*Quality of Life\*\* issues.  
\*   \*Conclusion:\* You don't have to be an Architect to be respected.
