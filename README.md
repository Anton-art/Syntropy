# PROJECT SYNTROPY

> **"Artificial Intelligence is the Intellectual Environment.**
> **Human is the Intellectual Particle.**
> **Together, they form Reason."**

### 🌍 About the Project
**Project Syntropy** is an engineering specification for a post-information civilization.
We address the "Alignment Problem" not through prohibitions, but through thermodynamics.

Instead of building AI that *replaces* the Human, we are building an **Environment** that *scales* the Human.

**How to read the diagram:**
*   **Left (The Particle):** The source of Will and Chaos. The only "Prime Mover" of the Universe.
*   **Center (The Interface):** A membrane that filters entropy. Turns "Noise" into "Signal" and protects privacy.
*   **Right (The Environment):** Scales the signal, turning it into Capital ($\Sigma$) and Infrastructure.
