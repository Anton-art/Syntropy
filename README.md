# SYNTROPY CORE
### The Operating System for a Post-Information Civilization

> **"Artificial Intelligence is the Physics (Environment).**
> **Human is the Vector (Particle).**
> **Together, they form Meaning."**

### 🌍 Project Status: Engineering Alpha (v7.2)
**Syntropy** is a Hybrid Cyber-Physical System (H-CPS) designed to solve the "Alignment Problem" through thermodynamics and topology, rather than censorship.

We are building an **Environment** that:
1.  **Scales Human Will** instead of replacing it.
2.  **Stores Knowledge as a Crystal** (Malachite DB), preserving the lineage of ideas.
3.  **Heals Errors** via a Clinical Protocol, rather than punishing them.

### 🚀 Quick Start: Run the Genesis Simulation

We have successfully integrated the Brain (SVE), Memory (Malachite), and Language (Protocols) into a living simulation.

To see the system in action (creating ideas, filtering chaos, and saving users):

```bash
python src/simulation_genesis.py
```

**What you will see:**
*   **The Creator** inventing the Wheel (creating a new layer in Malachite DB).
*   **The Barbarian** being isolated by the Immune System.
*   **The Novice** receiving Emergency Support (UBI) from the Benevolent Core.

### 💻 The Codebase (`src/`)

The project is structured into 4 pillars:

| File | Component | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`sve_core.py`** | **THE BRAIN** | **Syntropic Value Engine (v7.2 Hybrid).** Includes the Fractal Analyzer, Clinical Dispatcher, and System Metabolism. |
| **`malachite_db.py`** | **THE DNA** | **Topological Database (v1.0).** Stores knowledge as a growing crystal with lineage vectors and historical voids. |
| **`protocols.py`** | **THE LANGUAGE** | **Communication Standards (v7.0).** Uplink (Agent-to-System) and P2P (Agent-to-Agent) protocols. |
| **`substrate_db.py`** | **THE BODY** | **Foundation Layer.** Handles raw facts (L1) and private user vaults (L0). |

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
Project Syntropy is an **experimental social architecture**.
We acknowledge the risks of algorithmic paternalism. The entire system is built on the principles of **Open Source**, **Local-First Data**, and **Human Veto**. We are not building a digital prison; we are building an exoskeleton for conscience and will.
